Scientific Considerations and Technical Challenges." /><sentence text="For therapeutic proteins, the currently established standard development path generally does not foresee biotransformation studies by default because it is well known that the clearance of therapeutic proteins proceeds via degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids"><entity charOffset="268-279" id="DDI-PubMed.31748266.s2.e0" text="amino acids" /></sentence><sentence text=" In contrast to small molecules, there is no general need to identify enzymes involved in biotransformation because this information is not relevant for drug-drug interaction assessment and for understanding the clearance of a therapeutic protein" /><sentence text=" Nevertheless, there are good reasons to embark on biotransformation studies, especially for complex therapeutic proteins" /><sentence text=" Typical triggers are unexpected rapid clearance, species differences in clearance not following the typical allometric relationship, a mismatch in the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationship, and the need to understand observed differences between the results of multiple bioanalytical methods (e" /><sentence text="g" /><sentence text=", total vs" /><sentence text=" target-binding competent antibody concentrations)" /><sentence text=" Early on during compound optimization, knowledge on protein biotransformation may help to design more stable drug candidates with favorable in vivo PK properties" /><sentence text=" Understanding the biotransformation of a therapeutic protein may also support designing and understanding the bioanalytical assay and ultimately the PK/PD assessment" /><sentence text=" Especially in cases where biotransformation products are pharmacologically active, quantification and assessment of their contribution to the overall pharmacological effect can be important for establishing a PK/PD relationship and extrapolation to humans" /><sentence text=" With the increasing number of complex therapeutic protein formats, the need for understanding the biotransformation of therapeutic proteins becomes more urgent" /><sentence text=" This article provides an overview on biotransformation processes, proteases involved, strategic considerations, regulatory guidelines, literature examples for in vitro and in vivo biotransformation, and technical approaches to study protein biotransformation" /><sentence text=" SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Understanding the biotransformation of complex therapeutic proteins can be crucial for establishing a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship" /><sentence text=" This article will highlight scientific, strategic, regulatory, and technological features of protein biotransformation" /><sentence text="" /></document>
