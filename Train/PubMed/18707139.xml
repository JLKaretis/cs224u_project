<document id="18707139"><sentence text="Xenobiotic-activated receptors: from transcription to drug metabolism to disease." /><sentence text="Xenobiotic-activated receptors (XARs) are a group of ligand-activated transcription factors that are evolutionally specialized to regulate genomic programs to protect the body against innumerable chemicals from the environment" /><sentence text=" XARs share unique properties, such as promiscuous ligand binding, conserved structural motifs, common protein partners, and overlapping target genes" /><sentence text=" These unique features of XARs clearly distinguish them from receptors that are activated by endogenous chemicals to regulate energy metabolism, reproduction, and growth and differentiation" /><sentence text=" XARs regulate xenobiotic metabolism and disposition by controlling the expression and induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters" /><sentence text=" Furthermore, XARs integrate a broad range of protective mechanisms, such as antioxidative response and immune/inflammatory functions, to antagonize foreign chemicals" /><sentence text=" As the primary means of xenobiotic sensing and defense, XARs are intimately involved in drug disposition, polymorphic drug clearance, drug-drug interaction, and pathogenesis of some chemically induced cancers and chronic diseases" /><sentence text=" As a consequence, some XAR characteristics have been exploited in drug development and safety evaluation of drugs and environmental carcinogens and toxicants" /><sentence text=" In this perspective, common features and recent advances in the structures, modes of action, and implications in disease and drug development of XARs are discussed" /><sentence text="" /></document>
