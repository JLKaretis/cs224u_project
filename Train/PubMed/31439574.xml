Maximal induction was typically observed after 5-7 days of dosing" /><sentence text=" Thus, when the half-life of the inducer is less than 30 hours, are there benefits to a more standardized study design? A large proportion of CYP3A4 inducers were also CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inactivators based on in vitro data" /><sentence text=" In these cases, using CYP3A selective substrates has limitations" /><sentence text=" More intensive monitoring of changes in area under the curve over time is warranted" /><sentence text=" With selective CYP3A substrates, the net effect was often inhibition, whereas less selective substrates could discern induction through mechanisms not susceptible to inhibition" /><sentence text=" The latter included oral contraceptives, which raise concerns of reduced efficacy following induction" /><sentence text=" Alternative approaches for modeling induction, such as applying biomarkers and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK), are also considered" /><sentence text=" SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The goal of this commentary is to stimulate discussion on whether there are opportunities to optimize clinical drug-drug interaction study design" /><sentence text=" The overall aim is to reduce, understand and contextualize the variability observed in the magnitude of induction across reported clinical studies" /><sentence text=" A large clinical CYP3A induction dataset was collected and further analyzed to identify trends and gaps" /><sentence text=" Reporting individual victim PK data, characterizing perpetrator PK and including additional PK assessments for mixed-mechanism perpetrators may provide insights into how these factors impact differences observed in clinical outcomes" /><sentence text=" The potential utility of biomarkers and PBPK modeling are discussed in considering future directions" /><sentence text="" /></document>
