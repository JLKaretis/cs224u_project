<document id="27783531"><sentence text="The role of organic anion transporting polypeptides in drug absorption, distribution, excretion and drug-drug interactions." /><sentence text="The in vivo fate and effectiveness of a drug depends highly on its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME-Tox)" /><sentence text=" Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are membrane proteins involved in the cellular uptake of various organic compounds, including clinically used drugs" /><sentence text=" Since OATPs are significant players in drug absorption and distribution, modulation of OATP function via pharmacotherapy with OATP substrates/inhibitors, or modulation of their expression, affects drug pharmacokinetics" /><sentence text=" Given their cancer-specific expression, OATPs may also be considered anticancer drug targets" /><sentence text=" Areas covered: We describe the human OATP family, discussing clinically relevant consequences of altered OATP function" /><sentence text=" We offer a critical analysis of published data on the role of OATPs in ADME and in drug-drug interactions, especially focusing on OATP1A2, 1B1, 1B3 and 2B1" /><sentence text=" Expert opinion: Four members of the OATP family, 1A2, 1B1, 1B3 and 2B1, have been characterized in detail" /><sentence text=" As biochemical and pharmacological knowledge on the other OATPs is lacking, it seems timely to direct research efforts towards developing the experimental framework needed to investigate the transport mechanism and substrate specificity of the poorly described OATPs" /><sentence text=" In addition, elucidating the role of OATPs in tumor development and therapy response are critical avenues for further research" /><sentence text="" /></document>
