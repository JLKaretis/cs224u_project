<document id="17239835"><sentence text="Induction of drug metabolizing enzymes: a survey of in vitro methodologies and interpretations used in the pharmaceutical industry--do they comply with FDA recommendations?" /><sentence text="The FDA has published guidelines by which to carry out and interpret in vitro induction studies using hepatocytes but do researchers in pharmaceutical companies actually follow these to the letter? In a survey of 30 participants in the pharmaceutical industry, 19 questions were posed regarding the species investigated, methodologies and interpretations of the data" /><sentence text=" Also addressed was the in-house decision making processes as a result of in vitro induction data" /><sentence text=" The survey showed that, although the basic methods were similar, no two researchers carried out and interpreted induction assays in exactly the same way" /><sentence text=" No single method was superior but all included enzyme activities as the major end point" /><sentence text=" Hepatocytes from animal species were used to confirm animal in vivo data but only human hepatocytes were used to predict human induction responses" /><sentence text=" If a compound was found to be positive in an in vitro induction assay, few would halt the development of the compound" /><sentence text=" The majority would consider other properties of the compound (bioavailability, clearance and therapeutic concentrations) and follow the FDA recommendation to conduct clinical drug-drug interaction studies" /><sentence text=" Overall, the results from this survey indicate that there is no standard pharmaceutical industry method or evaluation criterion by which in vitro assays are carried out" /><sentence text=" Rather than adhering to the FDA guidelines, some adapt methods and interpretation according to their own experience and need (whether screening or lead optimisation)" /><sentence text=" There was general consensus that studies using human hepatocyte cultures currently provide the best indication of the in vivo induction potential of NCEs" /><sentence text=" In addition, the assessment of in vitro induction data from the literature suggest that the two-fold induction threshold and the percent of positive control criteria may not be the best methods to accurately assess the in vivo induction potential of a drug" /><sentence text=" Although the two-fold induction criterion is now obsolete, more predictive models for determining the clinical induction potential are needed" /><sentence text=" Alternative models are proposed and discussed herein" /><sentence text="" /></document>
