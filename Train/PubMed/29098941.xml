<document id="29098941"><sentence text="Efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein dominantly expresses on the membrane of red blood cells, hinders partitioning of its substrates into the cells, and alters drug-drug interaction profiles." /><sentence text="1" /><sentence text=" Red blood cell (RBC) partitioning is important in determining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a compound; however, active transport across RBC membranes is not well understood, particularly without transporter-related cell membrane proteomics data" /><sentence text=" 2" /><sentence text=" In this study, we quantified breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/Bcrp) and MDR1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) protein expression in RBCs from humans, monkeys, dogs, rats and mice using nanoLC/MS/MS, and evaluated their effect on RBC partitioning and plasma exposure of their substrates" /><sentence text=" BCRP-specific substrate Cpd-1 and MDR1-specific substrate Cpd-2 were characterized using Caco-2 TranswellÂ® system and then administered to Bcrp or P-gp knockout mice" /><sentence text=" 3" /><sentence text=" The quantification revealed BCRP/Bcrp but not MDR1/P-gp to be highly expressed on RBC membranes" /><sentence text=" The knockout mouse study indicated BCRP/Bcrp pumps the substrate out of RBCs, lowering its partitioning and thus preventing binding to intracellular targets" /><sentence text=" This result was supported by a Cpd-1 and Bcrp inhibitor ML753286 drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in mice" /><sentence text=" Because of enhanced partitioning of Cpd-1 into RBCs after BCRP/Bcrp inhibition, Cpd-1 plasma concentration changed much less extent with genetic or chemical knockout of Bcrp albeit marked blood concentration increase, suggesting less DDI effect" /><sentence text=" 4" /><sentence text=" This finding is fundamentally meaningful to RBC partitioning, pharmacokinetics and DDI studies of BCRP-specific substrates" /><sentence text="" /></document>
