A Value of Information-Based Framework Applied to Antiplatelet Drug Therapy." /><sentence text="The threshold of sufficient evidence for adoption of clinically- and genomically-guided precision medicine (PM) has been unclear" /><sentence text="" /><sentence text="To evaluate evidence thresholds for clinically guided PM versus genomically guided PM" /><sentence text="" /><sentence text="We develop an &quot;evidence threshold criterion&quot; (ETC), which is the time-weighted difference between expected value of perfect information and incremental net health benefit minus the cost of research, and use it as a measure of evidence threshold that is proportional to the upper bound of disutility to a risk-averse decision maker for adopting a new intervention under decision uncertainty" /><sentence text=" A larger (more negative) ETC value indicates that only decision makers with low risk aversion would adopt new intervention" /><sentence text=" We evaluated the ETC plus cost of research (ETCc), assuming the same cost of research for both interventions, over time for a pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing intervention and avoidance of a drug-drug interaction (aDDI) intervention for acute coronary syndrome patients indicated for antiplatelet therapy" /><sentence text=" We then examined how the ETC may explain incongruous decision making across different national decision-making bodies" /><sentence text="" /><sentence text="The ETCc for PGx increased over time, whereas the ETCc for aDDI decreased to a negative value over time, indicating that decision makers with even low risk aversion will have doubts in adopting PGx, whereas decision makers who are highly risk-averse will continue to have doubts about adopting aDDI" /><sentence text=" National recommendation bodies appear to be consistent over time within their own decision making, but had different levels of risk aversion" /><sentence text="" /><sentence text="The ETC may be a useful metric for assessing policy makers' risk preferences and, in particular, understanding differences in policy recommendations for genomic versus clinical PM" /><sentence text="" /></document>
