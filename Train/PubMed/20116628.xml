text="Etravirine (ETR) is a new antiretroviral drug of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) family that has recently been approved by the regulatory agencies for the treatment of

inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors" /><sentence text=" This approval was based on the results of the randomized double-blind DUET studies, in which the ETR arm was statistically superior to the placebo arms in terms of virological efficacy, immunological recovery, clinical progression and health- related quality of life"><entity charOffset="98-100"
