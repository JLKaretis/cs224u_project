Nine ADR studies were found that either included a D-DI category as a cause for hospital admissions, or provided sufficient information so that a causal relationship could be inferred" /><sentence text=" The incidence of hospital admissions due to D-DIs ranged from 0 to 2" /><sentence text="8%" /><sentence text=" The data found in the studies we reviewed, however, were insufficient to allow meaningful quantification of specific drugs as usual causes for D-DI-related admissions, and because of the very small numbers of patients for which a D-DI was believed to be the cause it is not possible to provide a meaningful summary of risk factors specific for D-DI admissions" /><sentence text=" We cannot conclude that D-DIs are a significant problem" /><sentence text=" There is a need to view the quantification of D-DIs in relation to the number of medications prescribed by physicians, dispensed by pharmacists and taken by patients" /><sentence text="" /></document>
